=======================================

Project aim
-----------
Physicspy aims at collecting frequently used calculations in physics,
and thus create a reusable and reviewed base for these calculations.
This would not replace proper understanding the underlying principles,
and the probably best practice for a beginner is to do their first 
calculations by hand. One, however, does not have to reinvent the wheel 
every single time, and when the principles are well understood, a 
reliable codebase can greatly improve the developement of software.


Dependencies
------------
Physicspy extensively relies on Numpy and Scipy. Please find more 
information about them, including installation instructions at 
http://www.scipy.org/


Contribution
------------
Please feel to correct bugs in the code, or extend its functionalit 
where it is lacking. I'd be grateful if you contribute your changes back 
to this original package, though I retain the right to include or 
omit any code submitted.
